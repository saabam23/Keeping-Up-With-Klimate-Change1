      <p class= personalCaption><strong>Hello everyone! My name is Sydney and I am from New Jersey! I am a rising senior in high school and also very passionate about using my coding skills to solve social issues. After gaining more experience in coding and attending programs like Kode With Klossy, I learned to open up about my views on certain issues and use my voice through coding to advocate for social justice. Entering the computer science has been a crazy journey but the most rewarding!</strong></p>
      <p class= personalCaption><strong>Hi! My name is Amy and I’m from New Jersey. I’m 17 years old and a rising Senior in highschool.  This is my first experience with coding and I’m excited to create more things in the future. Environmental justice has always been important to me and it’s exciting to know that with coding I can make an impact.
