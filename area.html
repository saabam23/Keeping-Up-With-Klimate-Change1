      <article class="germanyInfo hidden"> Germany- Germany is ranked as the third most affected country by climate risk because of the heat wave they suffered in 2018. It was the hottest year in its history with damages of more than 3,500 million dollars for the agricultural sector and a total of 1,246 deaths. </article>
      <article class = "canadaInfo hidden" > Canada- Government studies suggest that Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. In addition, weather events in 2018 caused 103 deaths. </article>
      <article class = "japanInfo hidden" > Japan- There are a wide variety of areas being targeted by the negative effects of climate change in Japan. In 2019, there were record low levels of snow, along with one of its strongest typhoons on record in October of the same year. Cherry trees are blossoming earlier every year, and because of the lack of snow melt, japanese agriculture is suffering.</article>
      <article class = "philippinesInfo hidden" > Philippines- Being a country that is surrounded by water, the Philippines are prone to many water based natural disasters. Climate change is expected to lead to more intense typhoons, higher sea levels, and storm surges. These storm surges are suspected to affect aproximately 14 % of the total population and 42 % of coastal populations </article>
      <article class = "madagascarInfo hidden" > Madagascar- Madagascar is a country with substandard agricultural conditions and a very dry climate. Due to climate change there have been rising temperatures and record droughts. These instances are damaging for both people and wildlife. Global warming and climate risks threaten the survival of the lemur and other endemic animal species on the island. </article>
      <article class = "kenyaInfo hidden" > Kenya- Kenya is very exposed to climate change, and there are suggested projections hinting that its average annual temperature will rise by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. As rainfall becomes more intense but less predictable, the slightest increase in droughts presents extreme challenges for food security and water availability, especially in the north and east where Kenya's arid and semi-arid areas are located. </article>
      <article class = "srilankaInfo hidden" > Sri Lanka- Sri Lanka is an island home to luscios forests and greens, but those forests along with the sri lankan population are at risk with the effects of climate change. Food insecurity continues to worsen and temperatures are continuing to rise. With the issues of the pandemic and their civil war, Sri Lanka has not had much time to put their focus towards climate change. This is exactly the issue many countries face, not realizing what will happen if they don't take action now to prevent a drastic future.</article>
      <article class = "indiaInfo hidden" > India- Indiaâ€™s high population density and poverty rates have made it especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. They have become more susceptible to extreme rainfall, longer dry spells, higher sea levels, and heat waves. This impacts India's agriculture and public health. There has been an increase in the national average surface air temperature and the number of hot days, significant regional variations in rainfall patterns, measurable melting of Himalayan glaciers, and a rise in sea level on both the coasts of the country. </article>
      <article class = "haitiInfo hidden" > Haiti- The island of Haiti is very vulnerable to hurricanes. Studies suggest that hurricanes are likely to get much more intense because of climate change. Haiti is a very poor country, making recovery from these natural disasters and prepping for storms especially challenging. </article>
