      <span class="mythHover">Renewable energy is only accessible when it isn't windy or raining</span>
      <span class="hovering">The industry is developing new techniques for storing electricity, so it is accessible at any time. </span>
    </button>

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">Polar bear numbers are increasing</span>
      <span class="hovering">The Arctic is warming almost twice as fast as the rest of world and scientists estimate that the polar bear population will decreasee by 30% by 2050</span>

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">Animals will adapt to climate change</span>
      <span class="hovering">Because of the speed of climate change, many species do not have enough time to adapt to the changing environment around them</span>
    </button>

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">Global warming isn't real because it's still cold</span>
      <span class="hovering">Climate change causes the earth's surface to become warmer, thus there will be more severe weather for longer periods of time. So, while there will be more droughts and heatwaves in some places, others will have more snow</span>
    </button>

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">Climate change is a future problem</span>

    </button> 

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">Plants need carbon dioxide</span>
      <span class="hovering">While it's true, they can only absorb so much CO2 and deforestation is only causing CO2 in our atmosphere to increase</span>
    </button> 

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">The Earth's climate has always changed</span>
      <span class="hovering">Over the course of the Earth's existance there have been climate changes, however natural warming and cooling that would normally take hundreds of years are happening in decades</span>
    </button> 

    <button class= "mythHover">
      <span class="mythHover">Renewable energy is just a money-making scheme</span>
      <span class="hovering">Solar power and onshore wind are the cheapest ways of generating electricity; meaning the energy they produce is cheaper than using nuclear, gas and fossil fuels, as well as being better for the environment. </span>
